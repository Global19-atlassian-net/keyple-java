# Keyple Remote Plugins - Network Lib

## Overview

The **Network Lib** Java library contains the common network elements used by the [Local Lib](../local/README.md) and [Remote Lib](../remote/README.md) libraries provided by the **Keyple Remote Plugins** solution.

This library **should not be import explicitly because it's imported by transitivity** by the main libraries.
